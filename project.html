          <h3>Wireframe / Prototype</h3>
          <p>
            A wireframe/prototype in the Predator Acer brand is a crucial early design tool that outlines the websites 
            structure, layout, and user journey before development begins. It helps visualize where key elements—such 
            as product highlights, performance specs, videos, and support links—will appear. For a high-performance, 
            gaming-focused brand like Predator, its essential to create an impactful digital presence that reflects power, 
            speed, and innovation. The prototype allows teams to test functionality, refine navigation, and ensure the 
            design aligns with user needs and brand identity. It reduces development errors, improves communication 
            among stakeholders, and ensures a seamless user experience. In short, its the blueprint that transforms
            ideas into an engaging and effective website that speaks directly to gamers and tech enthusiasts.

          <h3>Advanced inventory Research Defense</h3>
          <p>
            A simple advanced inventory management system in Java (terminal-based) is 
            a console application that allows users to efficiently manage stock items using 
            text-based commands. It typically includes features such as adding, updating, 
            deleting, and viewing product details like name, ID, quantity, and price. The 
            system may also support search functionality, stock level alerts, and basic 
            reporting to help users monitor inventory status. Using object-oriented 
            programming principles, the system ensures data organization through classes 
            and provides a user-friendly interface with menus and input prompts directly in the 
            terminal.

          <h3>Student Grade Calculator Exam</h3>
          <p>
            A student grade calculator in Java (terminal-based) is a simple program that 
            allows users to input a student's scores for assignments, quizzes, exams, or 
            other grading components. It calculates the total and average marks and 
            determines the corresponding grade (e.g., A, B, C) based on predefined 
            grading criteria. The program uses basic input/output operations and 
            conditional statements to process and display results in the terminal, making it 
            a useful tool for students or teachers to quickly assess academic performance
